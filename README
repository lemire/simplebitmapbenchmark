=== Questions ===

- How fast can you compute logical ORs between many bitmaps?
- What is the space-speed trade-off offered by the different libraries?



=== Libraries being tested ===

- compressedbitset 0.1
- extendedset 2.2
- JavaEWAH  http://code.google.com/p/javaewah/
- SparseBitmap  https://github.com/lemire/sparsebitmap and http://code.google.com/p/sparsebitmap/

=== How to use ===

Under MacOS or Linux, just execute the run.sh script.

Under Windows, just execute the run.bat script.
